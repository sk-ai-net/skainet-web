= How to Add a New Operation to a Compute Backend
:page-role: howto

Add or extend an operation via the backend abstraction and verify correctness via unit tests.

== Steps
. Locate the `ComputeBackend` SPI and the concrete backend (e.g., CPU).
. Add the op signature to the SPI.
. Implement the op in the backend.
. Write focused tests (shape checks, dtype checks, edge cases).
