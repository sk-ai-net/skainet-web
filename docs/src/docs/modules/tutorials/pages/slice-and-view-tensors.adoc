= Slice, View, and Reshape: Hands‑on with Tensor Views
:page-role: tutorial

This tutorial shows how to take sub‑tensors via slicing, build views without copying, and when/why materialization occurs.

== Prerequisites
* Completion of xref:build-first-tensor-cpu.adoc[this tutorial]
* Basic Kotlin proficiency

== Steps
. *Create a base tensor* (2D is great for intuition).
. *Slice* rows/columns using the provided indexing/slicing API.
. *Reshape* and *view* data without copying when possible.
. *Materialize* a view when you need a contiguous block.

NOTE: APIs are stabilized progressively on `develop`. Replace the pseudo‑calls with your current API names.
