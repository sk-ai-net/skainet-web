= Architecture Decisions

[role="arc42help"]
****
Important, expensive, large scale or risky architecture decisions including rationals.
With "decisions" we mean selecting one alternative based on given criteria.

Please use your judgement to decide whether an architectural decision should be documented here in this central section or whether you better document it locally (e.g. within the white box template of one building block).

Avoid redundancy. Refer to section 4, where you already captured the most important decisions of your architecture.

== Decision Records

=== ADR-001: Kotlin Multiplatform as Primary Technology

*Status*: Accepted

*Date*: 2024

*Context*: 
Need to choose a technology stack that enables cross-platform deployment while maintaining type safety and performance for tensor operations.

*Decision*: 
Use Kotlin Multiplatform as the primary development technology for the entire framework.

*Consequences*:

*Positive*:
* Single codebase with platform-specific optimizations
* Strong type safety with compile-time error detection
* Growing ecosystem with excellent tooling support
* Seamless integration with existing JVM and Android projects
* Modern language features improving developer productivity

*Negative*:
* Limited ecosystem compared to established ML frameworks

* Requires team expertise in Kotlin and multiplatform concepts

=== ADR-002: Pluggable Backend Architecture

*Status*: Accepted

*Date*: 2024

*Context*:
Different hardware platforms (CPU, GPU, TPU) require specialized optimizations, but the API should remain consistent across platforms.

*Decision*:
Implement a pluggable backend architecture with the `ComputeBackend<D, V>` interface as the abstraction layer.

*Rationale*:
* Enables hardware-specific optimizations without API changes
* Facilitates performance comparison between implementations
* Supports future hardware platforms without framework modifications
* Allows runtime backend selection based on availability

*Consequences*:

*Positive*:
* Clean separation between API and implementation
* Easy integration of specialized libraries (BLAS, CUDA, etc.)
* Performance optimization opportunities for each platform
* Future-proof architecture for emerging hardware

*Negative*:
* Additional abstraction layer may introduce overhead
* More complex testing matrix across different backends
* Potential for inconsistent behavior between backends

=== ADR-003: Comprehensive Performance Measurement Framework

*Status*: Accepted

*Date*: 2024

*Context*:
Performance is critical for machine learning workloads, requiring systematic measurement and optimization.

*Decision*:
Integrate comprehensive performance benchmarking directly into the framework with `BenchmarkRunner` and automated regression testing.

*Rationale*:
* Performance regression detection in CI/CD pipeline
* Systematic comparison of optimization attempts
* Data-driven performance optimization decisions
* Baseline establishment for different hardware platforms

*Implementation Details*:
```kotlin
class BenchmarkRunner {
    fun benchmark(
        name: String,
        warmupRuns: Int,
        measurementRuns: Int,
        operation: () -> T
    ): BenchmarkResult
}
```

*Consequences*:

*Positive*:
* Early detection of performance regressions
* Systematic performance optimization approach
* Clear performance expectations for users
* Data-driven architecture decisions

*Negative*:
* Increased build time due to benchmark execution
* Additional complexity in testing infrastructure
* Resource requirements for comprehensive benchmarking

=== ADR-004: Generic Type System with Compile-Time Validation

*Status*: Accepted

*Date*: 2024

*Context*:
Tensor operations are prone to shape and type mismatches that traditionally cause runtime errors.

*Decision*:
Leverage Kotlin's generic type system for compile-time validation of tensor operations.

*Design*:
```kotlin
interface Tensor<T : DType, V> : TensorData<T, V>, TensorOps<Tensor<T, V>>
interface ComputeBackend<D : DType, V> : TensorOps<Tensor<D, V>>
```

*Rationale*:
* Prevents common tensor operation errors at compile time
* Improves developer experience with IDE support
* Clear API contracts and documentation
* Type-safe operations without runtime overhead

*Consequences*:

*Positive*:
* Eliminates entire classes of runtime errors
* Better IDE support (autocompletion, refactoring)
* Self-documenting APIs through type signatures
* Performance optimization opportunities

*Negative*:
* Steeper learning curve for developers unfamiliar with generics
* More complex API signatures
* Potential compilation time increase

=== ADR-005: Module Separation: API vs Implementation

*Status*: Accepted

*Date*: 2024

*Context*:
Need clear boundaries between public contracts and implementation details to enable independent evolution.

*Decision*:
Separate the framework into distinct modules:
* `SKaiNET-tensors-api`: Pure interfaces and contracts
* `SKaiNET-tensors`: Reference CPU implementation
* Future: `SKaiNET-gpu`, `SKaiNET-distributed`, etc.

*Rationale*:
* Clear API boundaries and contracts
* Independent evolution of implementations
* Easier testing and mocking capabilities
* Reduced compilation dependencies

*Consequences*:

*Positive*:
* Clean architecture with well-defined boundaries
* Multiple implementations possible without API changes
* Better testability with interface mocking
* Faster incremental compilation

*Negative*:
* Additional complexity in project structure
* More modules to maintain and version
* Potential for API/implementation version mismatches

=== ADR-006: Memory Management Strategy

*Status*: Accepted

*Date*: 2024

*Context*:
Different platforms have different memory management characteristics requiring platform-specific approaches.

*Decision*:
Adopt platform-specific memory management strategies:
* JVM: Leverage garbage collection with array reuse optimization
* Native: Manual memory management with RAII patterns
* JavaScript: Browser GC with TypedArray optimizations

*Rationale*:
* Optimal performance on each platform
* Leverages platform-specific optimizations
* Consistent API despite different underlying strategies

*Consequences*:

*Positive*:
* Platform-optimized performance characteristics
* Reduced memory fragmentation on native platforms
* Efficient garbage collection on managed platforms

*Negative*:
* Platform-specific debugging requirements
* Different performance characteristics across platforms
* Increased complexity in memory profiling

=== ADR-007: Operator Overloading for Mathematical Operations

*Status*: Accepted

*Date*: 2024

*Context*:
Mathematical tensor operations should feel natural and intuitive to developers familiar with mathematical notation.

*Decision*:
Implement operator overloading for common mathematical operations:

```kotlin
val c = a + b           // Element-wise addition
val d = a * b           // Element-wise multiplication  
val e = a.matmul(b)     // Matrix multiplication
val f = a + 5.0         // Scalar addition
```

*Rationale*:
* Intuitive mathematical syntax
* Reduced boilerplate code
* Familiar to developers from other ML frameworks
* Clear distinction between operations (+ vs matmul)

*Consequences*:

*Positive*:
* Improved developer experience and code readability
* Reduced learning curve for users familiar with NumPy/PyTorch
* Less verbose mathematical expressions
* Natural mathematical notation

*Negative*:
* Potential confusion between element-wise and matrix operations
* Operator precedence considerations
* May hide computational complexity

== Rejected Alternatives

*Rejected*: Using pure Java for broader compatibility

*Reasons*:
* Missing modern language features (null safety, coroutines)
* Verbose syntax reducing developer productivity
* No multiplatform capabilities
* Limited type system compared to Kotlin
