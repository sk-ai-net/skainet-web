== Requirements Overview

=== What is SKaiNET?

SKaiNET is an open-source deep learning framework written in Kotlin, designed with developers in mind to enable the creation of modern AI-powered applications with ease. The framework provides a comprehensive tensor computation system with multiple backend support for different hardware platforms.

=== Key Features

* *Multi-dimensional Tensor Operations*: Complete support for tensor mathematics including matrix multiplication, element-wise operations, and broadcasting
* *Pluggable Backend Architecture*: Abstracted computation backends allowing CPU, GPU, and other hardware-specific implementations
* *Type-Safe API*: Kotlin-based type-safe tensor operations with compile-time shape and type checking
* *Performance Optimizations*: Built-in performance measurement and benchmarking framework for optimization analysis
* *Multiplatform Support*: Kotlin Multiplatform compatibility for cross-platform deployment
