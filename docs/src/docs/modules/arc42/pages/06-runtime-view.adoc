= Runtime View

[role="arc42help"]
****
The runtime view describes concrete behavior and interactions of the system's building blocks in form of scenarios for the following purposes:

* important use cases or features: how do building blocks execute them?
* interactions at critical external interfaces: how do building blocks cooperate with users and neighboring systems?
* operation and administration: launch, start-up, stop
* error and exception scenarios
****

== Tensor Creation and Initialization

=== Scenario: Creating a Tensor from Data

sequenceDiagram
    participant App as Application
    participant Tensor as CpuTensorFP32
    participant Shape as Shape
    participant Data as FloatArray

    App->>+Tensor: fromArray(shape, data)
    Tensor->>+Shape: validate dimensions
    Shape-->>-Tensor: validation result
    
    alt validation successful
        Tensor->>Tensor: create instance
        Tensor->>Data: copy/reference data
        Tensor-->>-App: Tensor<FP32, Float>
    else validation failed
        Tensor-->>-App: throw IllegalArgumentException
    end
....

*Description*: Application creates a tensor by providing shape and data array.

*Key Steps*:
1. Application calls factory method with shape and data
2. Shape validation ensures data array size matches dimensions
3. Tensor instance created with validated parameters
4. Reference or copy of data array stored internally

*Error Handling*:
* Invalid shape dimensions → `IllegalArgumentException`
* Data array size mismatch → `IllegalArgumentException`
* Null parameters → `NullPointerException`

        Backend->>+Result: create result tensor
        
        loop for each row i
            loop for each column j
                Backend->>TensorA: get row i
                Backend->>TensorB: get column j
                Backend->>Backend: dot product
                Backend->>Result: set(i, j, value)
            end
        end
        
        Backend-->>App: result tensor
        deactivate Result
    else incompatible shapes
        Backend-->>App: throw IllegalArgumentException
    end

    deactivate Backend
....

*Description*: Matrix multiplication between two tensors using CPU backend.

*Performance Characteristics*:
* Time Complexity: O(n³) for square matrices
* Space Complexity: O(n²) for result storage
* Memory Access: Sequential for optimal cache utilization

*Validation Rules*:
* Matrix A columns must equal Matrix B rows
* Both tensors must be 2-dimensional
* Compatible data types required

    end

    Runner->>+Stats: calculate statistics
    Stats->>Stats: compute mean, std dev
    Stats->>Stats: detect outliers
    Stats-->>-Runner: performance metrics

    Runner-->>-Test: BenchmarkResult
....

*Description*: Performance benchmarking framework measuring operation execution time.

*Measurement Process*:
1. Warmup phase to stabilize JVM performance
2. Measurement phase with precise timing
3. Statistical analysis of results
4. Outlier detection and removal

*Metrics Collected*:
* Execution time (mean, standard deviation, percentiles)
* Memory usage patterns
* Performance scaling characteristics
* Throughput measurements

== Error Handling Scenarios

    end

*Common Error Scenarios*:
* Shape incompatibility in operations
* Invalid tensor dimensions
