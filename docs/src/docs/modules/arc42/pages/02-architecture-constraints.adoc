= Architecture Constraints

[role="arc42help"]
****
Any requirement that constrains software architects in their freedom of design and implementation decisions or decision about the development process. These constraints sometimes go beyond individual systems and are valid for whole organizations and companies.

== Technical Constraints

[options="header",cols="1,3,2"]
|===
| Constraint | Description | Background

| Kotlin Multiplatform
| Framework must be implemented in Kotlin and support multiplatform deployment (JVM, Native, JS)
| Enables cross-platform compatibility and leverages Kotlin's type safety features

| Memory Management
| Must work efficiently within JVM garbage collection and native memory constraints
| Critical for performance in tensor operations with large data arrays

| No External Dependencies
| Core tensor operations should minimize external dependencies
| Reduces complexity, improves security, and enables easier deployment

| Backward Compatibility
| API changes must maintain backward compatibility following semantic versioning
| Ensures stable integration for dependent applications and libraries
|===

== Organizational Constraints

[options="header",cols="1,3,2"]
|===
| Constraint | Description | Background

| Open Source License
| Must use permissive open source license (likely Apache 2.0 or MIT)
| Enables broad adoption in commercial and academic contexts

| GitFlow Development
| Development follows GitFlow branching model with feature branches
| Ensures structured release management and code quality

| Test-Driven Development
| All features must have comprehensive test coverage including benchmarks
| Maintains code quality and performance regression detection

| Documentation Standards
| All public APIs must be documented with KDoc and architecture with Arc42
| Ensures maintainability and ease of adoption
|===

== Conventions

[options="header",cols="1,3,2"]
|===
| Convention | Description | Rationale

| Semantic Versioning
| Follows SemVer (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH) for all releases
| Provides clear expectations about API changes and compatibility

| Kotlin Coding Standards
| Adheres to official Kotlin coding conventions and style guide
| Ensures consistent, readable codebase across all modules

| Performance Benchmarking
| All core operations must include performance benchmarks
| Enables performance regression detection and optimization tracking

| Type Safety First
| Leverages Kotlin's type system for compile-time error detection
| Reduces runtime errors and improves developer experience
