= Quality Requirements

[role="arc42help"]
****
This section contains all quality requirements as quality tree with scenarios. The most important ones have already been described in section 1.2. (quality goals)

Here you can also capture quality requirements with lesser priority, which will not create high architectural impact. Consider this section as a structured collection of requirements. Use it also to capture architecturally relevant quality requirements that you might not have thought of when writing section 1.2.
