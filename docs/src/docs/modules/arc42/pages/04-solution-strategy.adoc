= Solution Strategy

[role="arc42help"]
****
A short summary and explanation of the fundamental decisions and solution strategies, that shape the system's architecture. These include

* technology decisions
* decisions about the top-level decomposition of the system
* decisions on how to achieve key quality goals
* relevant organizational decisions
****

== Technology Decisions

=== Kotlin Multiplatform as Foundation

*Decision*: Use Kotlin Multiplatform for the entire framework implementation.

*Rationale*:
* Enables true cross-platform deployment (JVM, Native, JavaScript)
* Provides excellent type safety and null safety features
* Allows sharing business logic while maintaining platform-specific optimizations
* Growing ecosystem with strong tooling support

*Consequences*:
* Framework can target multiple platforms with single codebase
* Leverages Kotlin's advanced type system for tensor shape validation
* Requires understanding of multiplatform constraints and limitations

=== Backend Abstraction Pattern

*Decision*: Implement pluggable backend architecture with `ComputeBackend` interface.

*Rationale*:
* Allows optimization for different hardware platforms (CPU, GPU, TPU)
* Enables easy integration of specialized libraries (BLAS, CUDA, etc.)
* Supports future hardware without API changes
* Facilitates performance comparison between implementations

*Consequences*:
* Clean separation between API and implementation
* Potential runtime overhead from abstraction layer
* Complex testing matrix across different backends

== Architectural Patterns

=== Layered Architecture

*Benefits*:
* Clear separation of concerns
* Easy to test individual layers
* Backend implementations can be developed independently
* API remains stable while implementations evolve

=== Strategy Pattern for Backends

*Decision*: Use Strategy pattern for compute backend selection and execution.

*Implementation*:
* `ComputeBackend<D: DType, V>` interface defines operations contract
* Runtime backend selection based on availability and performance
* Each backend optimized for specific hardware characteristics

== Quality Goal Achievement Strategies

=== Performance Strategy

*Approach*:
* Comprehensive benchmarking framework integrated into the build process
* Performance regression detection in CI/CD pipeline
* Hardware-specific optimizations through pluggable backends
* Memory-efficient tensor data structures

*Implementation*:
* `BenchmarkRunner` class for consistent performance measurement
* Automated performance testing in `BaselinePerformanceTest`
* Memory usage tracking and optimization recommendations

=== Type Safety Strategy

*Approach*:
* Leverage Kotlin's type system for compile-time error detection
* Generic type parameters for data types and value types
* Shape validation at tensor creation time
* Operator overloading for intuitive mathematical syntax

*Implementation*:
```kotlin
interface Tensor<T : DType, V> : TensorData<T, V>, TensorOps<Tensor<T, V>>
```

=== Extensibility Strategy

*Approach*:
* Plugin architecture for compute backends
* Service Provider Interface (SPI) pattern
* Clean separation between API and implementation
* Documentation-driven development for extension points

== Organizational Decisions

=== Development Process

*Decision*: Adopt GitFlow with comprehensive testing requirements.

*Implementation*:
* Feature branches for all development
* Mandatory code review process
* Automated testing including performance benchmarks
* Documentation updates required for all API changes

=== Open Source Strategy

*Decision*: Full open source development with permissive licensing.

*Benefits*:
* Community contributions and feedback
* Transparency in implementation decisions
* Academic and commercial adoption
* Integration with broader Kotlin ecosystem

=== Modular Architecture

*Decision*: Separate API and implementation into distinct modules.

*Structure*:
* `SKaiNET-tensors-api`: Pure interfaces and contracts
* `SKaiNET-tensors`: Reference implementations
* Future modules: `SKaiNET-gpu`, `SKaiNET-distributed`, etc.

*Benefits*:
* Clear API boundaries
* Independent evolution of implementations
* Easier testing and mocking
* Reduced compilation dependencies
